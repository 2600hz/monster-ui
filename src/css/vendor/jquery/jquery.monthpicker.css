/*
The plugin uses buttons with a transparent background in the year-table
(aka header) in order to look consistent with jQuery UI datepicker and to
make the year title a button that blends into the heading in the default state.

The plugin does this by removing the .ui-state-default class from (in MonthPicker.js)
the a tags (buttons) which also ends up removing the 1px border that it applies.

To prevent the button from resizing and moving everything around when you hover
in and out, we use a carefully constructed selector, which gets overroden by the
more specific .ui-state-hover/actove class selectors in the jquery-ui.css
that apply the visible borders that we want.

This selector applies a 1px transparent border that keeps the button
in the same size, but it doesen't hide the borders that .ui-state-hover/actove give us.

The buttons in the heading (year-table) are slightly shrinked, but because jQuery ui and
the .month-picker .ui-button-text rule at the top of this CSS file apply some
padding which results in the button text being moved to the bottom of
the button.

This rule removes the unnecessary padding so the text in
the jump years button will be vericaly centred.
