				"question": "How quickly will I know if my port request has been rejected?",
				"answer": "You will be notified, by our Porting Department, that a request has been rejected within that day or the subsequent day we receive the notice."

Once you receive a port date from the gaining provider, you are responsible for deleting the number from the Account."
