# .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file of Monster UI only specifies untracked directories related to the project itself, which are:

- directories created/deleted during the build process (`tmp/`, `dist/`, `distRequire/`)
- dependency directories (`node_modules/`)
- any none core app directory (`src/apps/*` minus core apps)

Because we can't possibly know all combinations of operating system/text editor/IDE you are using, we leave it to you to exclude which files/directories are specific to your environment.

Nowadays, this task is trivial and made really simple by using two different tools: `.gitignore_global` & gitignore.io

### `.gitignore_global`

The idea here is, instead of polluting every projects' `.gitignore` files with environment specific exclusion rules, let each user define locally on their machine which ones are relevant to their environment once and for all.

This way, only project specific exclusion rules are stored in the `.gitignore`!

Check out the [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/#create-a-global-gitignore) to understand how to tell `git` to look for that file.

### gitignore.io

But how could you possibly now every files and directories generated by your environment, that sounds impossible! Enter gitignore.io that allows to you generate a custom exclusion list tailored to your environment. This tool is accessible in two different flavors:

- on the [website](https://www.gitignore.io/)
- as a [command line](https://www.gitignore.io/docs) shortcut

Once your exclusion list is generated, paste it into your `.gitignore_global` file and you are done!
