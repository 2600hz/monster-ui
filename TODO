Near future
= Change all CSS files to SCSS files. Importing base.scss in each file.
= Have a mode for dev where we don't concatenate and a mode for prod where we do concatenate: goal is to load only one scss file at the end.
= Add require.js r.js to gulp and see if we can make it work so we could skip the build process that currently exists.

Dream future
= Add a mode in prod to automatically add a version to the files so we can bust cache automatically
= Add minification of the JS with dev / prod mode
= Add minification of the HTML with dev / prod mode. Seei f Handlebars can work with one big js file containing all our templates.
