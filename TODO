Immediate future
= commit apps/* to their own repos
= see where we use gutil

Near future
= improving readability and organization of our gulpfile
= Change all CSS files to SCSS files. Importing base.scss in each file.
= Improve our watch tasks so dev becomes easier
= see about organizing sass in a better fashion

Dream future
= Add a mode in prod to automatically add a version to the files so we can bust cache automatically
= See about adding min suffixes
= see about sitemaps
= i18n concat?

Cleanup gulpfile
= casing
= use del.sync to delete stuff

move-files => Move everything to tmp.
sass => take all tmp/scss files and compile them and make them css files
templates => take all html templates in tmp/apps/*/views/*.html and compile them into js/templates.js file, remove all the apps/*/views/*html files from tmp
require => run require on whole setting, from tmp to tmpRequire, then move eveyrhting back to tmp
minifyjs => takes tmp/js/main.js and tmp/js/templates.js and minify them
css => takes tmp/css/style.css and minifies it
write-config => writes a config file for monster to know which apps were bundled (used by monster.css, to prevent it from loading css files)
move-to-dist => move the whole folder except scss files, html files, to /dist. clean tmp
