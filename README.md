Required Softwares:
- Node >= 4.5.0 (from their website)
- NPM >= 3.10.6 (npm install -g npm)
- GULP >= 3.9.1 (npm install -g gulp)

Once those tools installed, you just have to run the "gulp" command and it will serve a dev version of the website.

If you install all the separate apps via GIT as submodules in the /monster-ui/src/apps folder and then run "gulp build-prod", all the apps code (JS/HTML/CSS) will be concatenated together and minified
